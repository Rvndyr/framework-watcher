      I used Vuejs and BootstrapVue to create this webapp. Using axios to make github api calls, I was able to render
      the specific data from each response I received.
      <br />
      was able to create an array for all the repos I wanted to make a GET request with and loop through the array to
      dynamically make a call for each item in the array. This allows you to add an additional repo in one place and it
      can dynamically render to the table without having to update code in multilple areas.
